Project description

 It's time to build a memorial for all those pigs who have to live their lifes 
under the insane circumstances of the industrial food production.

 For all those pigs who have to rest in pain.
 For all those pigs who give their lives to feed the world. For all those pigs 
who get killed for nothing.

 Do you know that 50% of all pigs get slaughtered in Germany, although their 
meat, grease or leather never reaches the market?

Seriously it is time to honor all the pigs.
With a game - this game.

Because this game is the pig thing, an epig story

<the naked pig image> 

 I have to confess, it's hard to tell a story - especially mine.

Once upon a time - like every year - new years eve was rising.

Well prepared I went out to attend the ultimate party of this year like it is 
1999. When I wanted to cross the street, a wild boar passed by on his Harvey 
Davidson. A vertex storm of mud, mist and wind came up and flushed away my 
clothes. In the mild breeze of twenty degree Fahrenheit I stand alone in the 
dark The street lanterns were spending a glimpsy shade of light.

I was totally naked!
Boy, what a feeling. It was the most humiliating situation I ever felt into.

So I rushed into the next open bar to go straight forward towards the restrooms 
to pick up a towel and cover myself. But it was new years eve. The bar was 
packed full with people. Finally I managed to reach the restrooms without 
drawing any attention on me. I picked up some towels and I was dressed again 
more or less.
 And than she was standing there in the entrance of that bar, the love of my 
lifetime. Your Mum, kids, the most beautiful Easter Rabbit in the world.

<the how I ate your father picture>

And that bastard wild boar, who caused the accident, was standing at the bar 
laughing out loud. He looked like the cat who ate the canary. 
Before I could reach your Mum, she was dragged out of the bar by her girl 
friends. She disappeared out of my life as soon as she intruded it.
Packed with anger and a broken heart I pushed into the wild boar driver.
That was your Uncle Wild Boar Randy.

He excused, explained the heavy vortex winds on the street. He helped me to calm 
down. He told me to stay focused on the one thing - finding your Mum. He was my 
personal driver for the next days. Also he borrowed me his jacked and his 
helmet. So we became friends.

to be continued ... ... by your pledge and play.

 You do may wonder, how a complicated story could fit into a simple game like a 
puzzle game, don't you?
 You ask yourself, if a love story can be a playable game.
 But if you play Puzzle Pirates or Puzzle Quest or any kind of adventure games, 
if you like to solve brain cracking puzzles, here might be the answer. Pledge 
'Love Road', so I can realize this game soon.

 Anyway you should play the game, because the unique puzzle mechanics of 'Love 
Road' can deliver those experiences mentioned before to you all at once. This 
is an epic puzzle story - a love story never told before.
