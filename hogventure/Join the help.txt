If you build an application, one of the basic problems will getting the start up 
right. You should always imagine, what a untrained user is willing to do first.
Maybe he won't login, although this seems to be necessary for an online 
application. Here is the simple solution, make it possible to work offline, 
too.*

*a simple solution that is not so simple by the way.

The problem of the right 'start up' process is caused by your evil knowledge 
about what a user should be able to do with this application. So you know how to 
organize the application, input of title here, preferences, metadata, chat, 
teammates, overview, gloabal anlyzation, test environment, painting tool for 
backgrounds, objects, animations - an endless list for somebody who is new.

You should give him help. That is why you integrated the help button. Seriously
writing the help is part of the documentation. Never forget, you must start the 
documentation process before you start the coding process. The first lines of 
you code should be documentation commentary. Don't care about the licence or 
other stupid questions. You see, this is another start up problem, isn't it?

Don't be shy to rewrite your code and reuse it over and over again. Reuse the 
doumentation and fix it over and over. Try to explain what to do first and why. 
This will answer most of the questions a user may have. 
And for your own sacrifice/saints, this will help you to detect bugs and 
misstakes and provide the better code.**

**Over 70% of code should be comentary documentation. Over 80% of a project like 
a game is documentation. In anyway this includes the production of music, art, 
graphic assets, code, communiction, the plan. A good plan helps you to build a 
good business.

Instead of starting with two buttons like 'login' and 'offline', your 
application should start with a sentence like: 
<div style="border: 1px #999 solid; margin: 10px; box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px #999; 
padding: 8px; width: 80%; text-align: center;">
<br />Hello user! <br /><br />Choose to <br /><span>'Login'</span><br /> or <br 
/><a href="http://hogventure.com/beastlyBoars/index.html"><span>'create an 
offline project'</span></a><br />
to start building a new game.<br /><br /></div>

A nice welcome message gives trust and makes the user feel comfortable.

So don't be shy join the help and create a path for the new beginners.
