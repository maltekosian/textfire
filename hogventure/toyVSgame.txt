D'n'D pen and paper as the ancestors of the most computer games is a lie because of colosual cave and adventure

words versus grafics - a (language) problem, but not a confrontation (nethack)

RPG, because we all play roles all times massivly

We are here to tell stories, but we don't like to line them up.
We are here to tell stories, but we don't like limited wor(l)ds.
We are here because we like stories, but we don't want to do this on our own.

Instead we invent rules to establish a system to cooperate(coexist) with others in an "open" environment on regulated basis.
The price we pay is that we depend on luck and the lack of ..., that's what dices make. (... => freedom, rules, skills, trust, love, ..., story)

Don't forget words always have double meaning.
They mean something - they are mean.
