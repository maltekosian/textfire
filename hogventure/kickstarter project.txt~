'MURDER :: WHO ...?', a crime stories episodical seasson - nobody knows Dog, but 
he has a bureau of investigations. Eberhard runs the office, and the pigs are 
doing their job a the detectives. Sometimes Dog interupts their works via old 
fashined phone, loudspeakers or something similar. No angels will be harmed, if 
we make this stories: 'MURDER :: WHO eats bacon and cheese?', 'MURDER :: WHO 
smells like a fish?', 'MURDER :: WHO talks to loud and sings like a sistrum?',
'MURDER :: WHO likes love, labor, lost?', 'MURDER :: WHO hears the news today?'

'The Secret Life of the © Monkeys', a nature reportage
seassonal about the secret life of the copyrighted monkeys. The © monkeys live 
on a little vulcano island near by that continent beginning with the capital 
'A'. Join Professor McJimmac on his expedition. Help to detect the © monkeys, 
investigate their natural environment with those scary lifeforms and plants - 
bees and peas - take awesome photoshots for documentary and solve incredible 
puzzles based on the number 3. This is not another bejeweled clone. In short - 
run for you life.

'Cock Roach & Lady Bug', a love story. 
Cock is an American seaman 'new' to the habour city. A guy without work. He 
finds no ship anymore. Than he meets a lady, so he thinks, Lady Bug, and so he 
treads her. But she is an prostitute. Both they are just stranded people in a 
big city, bigge than life. This is tragical epic love story from the 
underground, if you know Mecki Messer.

'PROJECT RUNAWAY', an escapade.
If you are an Easter rabbit girl from the Easter Islands your 
job oppertunities run short. You can work in the EGG-factory. That's it. But 
Bunny Usagi has a dream. As a kid she read a fashion style bible. That was just 
200 years ago. Now as a teen, she wants to be an fashion designer. Once Bunny 
Usagi managed to get up the hole, she travels far away from home to see the 
world and joins a top (pottery) model casting show. That's where everything 
turns strange.

'development', You want me to put all the money into the development of the 
tools
 

Project description

You may wonder, why this editor tool set is called HOGventure? Here is the 
explanation for name HOGventure: Hidden Object Game Adventures. At least this is 
why I build the editor and what I want to do with it. 

But you may create a storytelling jump'n'run, a shooter with dialog puzzles, any 
kind of games and flavor.

Strangely enough this tool enables everyone to create storytelling games, 
indeed. All stages of experiences may apply as the entry level. Students from 
schools, collages, universities, your grandma and pa? Everyone, who knows to 
write, read and use a computer, should give this tool a try. Even professionals.

Game-writers, narrative designers and students of those crafts can write, test 
and analyze their story, dialogs and object contributions. Any kind of game 
designer can use editor to build a play test of their game. 

Because this tool will include a raw sketch editor, anyone can create a full 
visual representation of the game. The ability to include and 'manipulate' 
audios and movies will also be given.
Plugins can be written in javascript easily. 

In the last stage of the development 3d environments will be supported, too.

For the HELP a 'game' will explain how the tools and your friends work together. 
This is not planed as a single user tool. Groups of coworkers with different 
talents can elaborate a game. Educators may watch the projects of their students 
and give advice.

The data is export in the JSON data format. You can run the games with the build 
in HTML5 game player. You might use this player to show your game on your 
webpage or include it on facebook. 

The player will run as an standalone app on Android devices. On Android tablets 
the editor will run a an app. Touchscreens are supported. 

Some technical words: I use HTML5, javascript for the basic programming, 
Dropbox, Firebase and other public available internet plattforms to save and 
share the data between you and your coworkers. In the future some of those might 
cost some money. As long they don't, everything will stay free. Otherwise I will 
run a second founding campaign.  

The data-format, the player and the editor will be open source, if this project 
get founded. So this shall be a free tool. This project requires your support!

Stage 1: We get the 7500$. The tool will be released in a free version.

Stage 2: If the projects gets more money, let's say 10.000$ something, I try to 
build an Apple iOS player and the iOS editor for the apple tablets.

Stage 3: Once the founding breaks the 17.500$ barrier, I will create one the 
games until March. Which one, depends one your choice. Do not forget to vote!

Stage 4: The 25.000$ barrier enables me to create better art, music, sounds.

Stage 5, 6, ... : For another pocket full of 25.000$ another game will be 
produced 

Final Stage: Once I can engage programmers, 3d support will be build in as soon 
as possible. That's about 100.000$ or more.
