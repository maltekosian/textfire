Can you reach 5000 users on a marketing budget of zero?

10 % paying users = 500 (1% = 50) weekly * 1€ = 500€, monthly = 2000€

model: season games in episodes (.., 4 months a 17 episodes, 3 months a 13 
episodes, .., 1 month a 5 episodes)

a missing episode(online only) = 79Cents
the whole season subsription(online) = (1 month = 2.50€, 2 months = 4.00€, 3 
months = 5.00€, 4 months = 6€, .. + 1 € a month)
offline cd/dvd media (online + 11.00€)

offline special cd/dvd media feelies pack (25€ to 75€) - this is normal retails 
business, but direct marketing

special episodes for xmas, eastern, olympics, super bowl, soccer wm/em, other 
internatonal events and catastrophies like ehec, swine flu, bird flu, bse, 
tsunamies, elections of global interest (usa, ..) for free or as payed 'the day 
after' service 


a year with 24.000€ one game (risk -50% = 12.000€)
a year with 50.000€ two games (risk -40% = 30.000€)
a year with 80.000€ three games (risk -25% = 60.000€)
a year with 120.000€ four games (risk -10% = 105.000€)
...

The more games and original IPs you have, the richer the penetration of the
market will be.

BUT YOU SHOUL DO THIS:

THE WHOLE hog VENTURE

closset games - more a business model 
		episodical seasonal distribution 
		collector games and items and specials

5on5 games -	a condense, shrink it to the minimal 
		fast iteration 
		a parametrics engine
		use this for plugins in the hogventure engine

hogventure -	a storification game engine
		enables to make closset games with 5on5 games.

that's the things that have to be combined
some assumtions made in the back: fast iteration, short game play 
(10 minutes fast runs or less) about 35 to 75 minutes gameplay.
artistic assets - music and visual art
no content mill trash
follow the KISS paradigm always

we need at least for the next 3 years 1.500.000 €uros

the plan is 
	penetrate the market with the model 
	to evaluate and establish IPs
	both takes some time

produce new 3 games short seasons of 5 to 10 episodes max a year
9 different IPs over the next 3 years

one an ip response to the market
produce more content and another season of the game
we will need more stuff!
