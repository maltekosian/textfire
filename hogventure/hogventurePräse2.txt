What can you do?
....................
in general create a storytelling game

it is a sort of small HTML5 based "adventure" engine 
that might be used for hidden object games, too

games are driven by dialogs, objects or combination of both
--------------------
How does it work?
....................
a game is build as a "slideshow"

slides - you may say scenes, rooms, stages are attached
(o)N(e) after another

so you have multiple paths
--------------------
How does a game look alike?
....................
the top shows title, points and some other information or general options

on the left hand you see the visited slides

on the right the players bag with the collected objects

the dialogs will popup at the bottom always
--------------------
What happens inside a slide?
....................
dialogs provide the basic way for selections, options and choices

simular to the slides you may have multiple paths

each choice is a text

each text has a target

objects, dialogs and slides are targets

"activities" are targets, too
--------------------
Whats an activity?
....................
activities are special targets for objects

you can hide and show objects

add them to the bag and drop them from the bag to the current slide

you may combine them with other present objects

objects are present if they are in the bag or in the current slide
--------------------
Sometimes ...
....................
a target can be conditional

you can check if specific objects are in the bag

you want to link to an url - you can do that
